# Graphology-SVM
To run the project, run train_predict.py

The flow of the project goes as follows:
    train_predict.py -> unique_pers.py, traits.py -> features.py ->  image_processing.py

listing.py is for practice and is not used in the final code. Its correct code is in traits.py.

raw_feature_list, feature_list and label_list are created in traits.py for training. It contains raw and categorized features of the handwriting images extracted in the project and then their corresponding labels are calculated.
